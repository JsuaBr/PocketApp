# PocketApp
The idea here it's to make an app in which you can create notes, see the weather, the time and take care of a virtual pet. It's obviously an app to practice tons of things in angular, but I really want to migrate it to react native in a future.

# Design
The design it's entirely made by me, here's the link to see it: https://www.figma.com/design/Ok4TdnD8BONcYJhGmtdkij/Angular-Application?node-id=7-3&t=g55iMIuIFApenprg-1
It's made in figma and at this date it is not finished but it i'll be while I develop the app.
